# Introduction

Each PostgreSQL database contains one or more named schemas (a namespace for SQL objects)
which contain tables and other database object.

By default tables (and other objects) are in a database automatically put into a schema
named “public” but you can create additional schemas.

There are several reasons to use schemas:

- To allow many users to use one database without interfering with each other.
- To organize database objects into logical groups to make them more manageable.
- Third-party applications can be put into separate schemas so they do not collide with the names of other objects.

`monolayer` allows you to manage multiple schemas in a single database.
