# Custom migrations

From time to time, you may need to:
- Create database objects not managed by `monolayer`.
- Perform data migrations.

For those cases, you can write custom migrations.

**Steps**

1. Scaffold a new migration with the following command:

```bash
npx monolayer scaffold
```

This will create a new migration file in the configuration's `migrations` folder with the name of your choice.

```ts title="migrations/${configurationName}/${timestamp}-${migrationName}.ts"
import { Kysely } from "kysely";
import { Migration } from "monolayer/migration";

export const migration: Migration = {
  scaffold: true,
  dependsOn: "2024034553434-previous-migration-name",
};

export async function up(db: Kysely<any>): Promise<void> {
};

export async function down(db: Kysely<any>): Promise<void> {
};
```

2. Modify the `up` and `down` functions to perform the desired operations.

Example:
```ts title="migrations/${configurationName}/${timestamp}-${migrationName}.ts" {10-14,18}}
import { Kysely } from "kysely";
import { Migration } from "monolayer/migration";

export const migration: Migration = {
  scaffold: true,
  dependsOn: "2024034553434-previous-migration-name",
};

export async function up(db: Kysely<any>): Promise<void> {
  await db.schema
    .createView('dogs')
    .orReplace()
    .as(db.selectFrom('pet').selectAll().where('species', '=', 'dog'))
    .execute()
};

export async function down(db: Kysely<any>): Promise<void> {
  await db.schema.dropView('dogs').execute();
};
```

:::warning
The `down` function is used to revert the operations performed in the `up` function.

When performing database schema changes, you should implement it to ensure you can safely go back to a previous state with the [rollback](../cli/rollback.md) CLI command.

3. Apply the migration with:

```bash
npx monolayer migrate
```
