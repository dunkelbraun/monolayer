# Configuration

`monolayer` will read your root `monolayer.config.ts` file to be able to manage your database schemas.
<br>
<br>
::: tip
If you installed `monolayer` with `create-monolayer`, the file is autogenerated, and you probably
won't need to modify it.
:::
<br>

After importing [`defineConfig`](./../reference/api/config/functions/defineConfig.md) from `monolayer/config`, you export a default configuration.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "monolayer/config";

export default defineConfig({
  databases: "app/db/databases.ts",
});
```

See the list of config options in the [Config API Reference](./../reference/api/config/functions/defineConfig.md).
