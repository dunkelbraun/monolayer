# Migration Warnings

From time to time, `monolayer` will have to generate a migration that could be lead to:
- Destructive changes.
- Backwards incompatibility.
- Block the database while applying the migration.
- Potential failures during the migration process.

For this reason, `monolayer` will generate a warning message to inform you about the potential issues that could be caused by the migration, and possible mitigation steps.

Here's an example of a warning message generated by `monolayer` when adding a `NOT NULL` constraint to an existing column:

```text
│
▲   WARNING  Migration might fail
│
│  - Changed column to non-nullable (column: 'name' table: 'users' schema: 'public')
│
│  Making a column non-nullable on an existing table may fail if the column contains `NULL` values.
│
│  How to prevent a migration failure and application downtime:
│    1. Remove `NULL` values from the column.
│    2. Ensure existing applications always insert non `NULL` values into the column.
│    3. Make the column non-nullable.
```
