# Database connections

### Configure connections

Each configuration can have multiple connections, such as `development`, `test`, and `production`.

To define the configurations, use the `connections` property in your configuration.

```ts title="configuration.ts"
import { type Configuration } from "monolayer/config";
import { dbSchema } from "./schema";
import { dbExtensions } from "./extensions";

export default {
  schemas: [dbSchema],
  extensions: dbExtensions,
  connections: {
    development: {
      // database credentials
    },
    test: {
      // database credentials
    },
    production: {
      // database credentials
    },
  },
} satisfies Configuration;
```

:::note
The only connection that's required is `development`. Other connection names are up to you.
:::

### Running CLI commands

Except `scaffold`, you can target connections in all `monolayer` CLI commands using the environment
option (short name `-c`, long name `--connection`)

In the following example, we are running the `migrate` command against `production`.

```bash
npx monolayer migrate -c production
```
